Each level includes short lectures on Java theory (one lecture per topic) and tasks to consolidate the obtained knowledge. Access to materials opens sequentially, as you progress through the course.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">2</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">What will I learn from CodeGym?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">First of all, you will learn Java Core. This is the core of the Java language - everything that EVERY potential Java Developer needs to know. And you will study this through practice, having solved more than 1200 tasks.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">3</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">How will learning on CodeGym benefit me?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">It’s impossible to become a programmer just by reading a book or watching a video! To learn how to program you need to...well, program, and form the "correct" programmer thinking.</p><p class="faq-list__item-answer">To help with this, there are more than 1,200 tasks of varying complexity and automatic verification. By solving all of the tasks you get more than 300-500 hours of practical experience. The combination of theory, practice, and - most importantly - review of the code you write - this is what CodeGym provides.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">4</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">Can I benefit from CodeGym if I already have previous Java experience?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">Definitely.The complexity of the course grows as you progress from level to level, and there are a bunch of pretty advanced tasks and even mini-projects.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">5</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">Can I study on your course if I don't have any basic programming skills?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">Sure! Our course was designed for complete beginners and doesn't require any skills or experience in programming.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">6</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">What is so special about your tasks? Isn't it better to program yourself and not pay for a "collection of tasks"?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">Firstly, it is not at all easy to find tasks which will help you develop in the right direction, especially for a novice developer. Secondly, even if the program works correctly and provides an answer, this does not mean that it has been solved correctly.</p><p class="faq-list__item-answer">This is why the automatic verification system plays an important role in our course. Our smart validator will instantly check your task, analyze any errors and send recommendations to eliminate them.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">7</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">What are the advantages of having a subscription?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">A subscription gives you sequential access to the CodeGym course — from level 0 to level 40. In addition to access to the course, you get a number of features included with a paid subscription - instant task verification, recommendations and detailed information on task verification, bonus tasks, mini-projects and much more.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">8</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">Is it possible to study without a subscription?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">On our Java course, you have the opportunity to complete 10 lessons for free. This will help you understand the features of CodeGym and assess whether our learning format is right for you. Further access will only be possible if you have a subscription.</p></li><li class="faq-list__item"><span class="faq-list__item-number">9</span><h3 class="title h3 faq-list__item-question">Can I cancel my subscription anytime?</h3><p class="faq-list__item-answer">Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Your subscription will auto-renew until you cancel, but why would you want to?</p></li></ul></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__background"></div><div class="footer-row"><div class="footer-text"><p class="footer-text__item">The best time to start learning Java is NOW!</p><p class="footer-text__item"> Start for free today</p></div><a class="btn-common footer__btn" id="button_id_get_started_now_last" href="signup.html">Get started now</a></div><div class="copyright"><div class="copyright__background"></div><img class="copyright__logo" data-src="static/img/logo/logo-white.svg" src="static/img/1x1.png" alt="Code GYM logo"><span class="copyright__text">© 2021 CodeGym "Programmers Are Made, Not Born"</span></div></footer></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="style/css/media-faq.min.css"><script src="script/js/faq.min.js"></script></body></html>
